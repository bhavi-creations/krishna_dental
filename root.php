                <p>A root canal is necessary when the pulp inside a tooth becomes inflamed or infected due to deep decay, cracks, or repeated dental procedures. At Krishna Dental, we use modern techniques to carefully clean the infected area, remove bacteria, and seal the tooth to prevent reinfection. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, ensuring comfort and minimal pain. With our experienced endodontists, we restore your tooth’s strength and function, preventing the need for extraction. After the treatment, we recommend a dental crown to protect and enhance durability. Our commitment to patient care ensures a seamless experience, from diagnosis to recovery. If you’re experiencing tooth pain, sensitivity, or swelling, visit Krishna Dental for a consultation and expert root canal treatment.
