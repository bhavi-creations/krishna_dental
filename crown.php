                    A dental crown is a protective cap placed over a damaged or weakened tooth, while a bridge replaces one or more missing teeth by anchoring onto adjacent teeth. At Krishna Dental, we provide high-quality crowns and bridges made from porcelain, ceramic, and metal for durability and aesthetics. These restorations improve bite function, protect teeth from further damage, and enhance your smile’s appearance. Our expert dentists use precise digital impressions to create comfortable, long-lasting solutions tailored to your needs. Crowns and bridges not only restore missing teeth but also prevent shifting and misalignment. If you have a fractured, decayed, or missing tooth, visit Krishna Dental for expert restorative solutions and regain your confident smile.
