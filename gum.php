Gum disease is a common but serious condition caused by plaque buildup, poor oral hygiene, and bacterial infections. At Krishna Dental, we offer specialized gum treatments, including deep cleaning (scaling and root planing), laser therapy, and medication-based solutions to restore gum health. If left untreated, gum disease can lead to bleeding gums, bad breath, and even tooth loss. Our skilled periodontists provide personalized treatment plans to manage and reverse gum issues effectively. We also educate patients on maintaining proper oral hygiene to prevent recurrence. Whether you’re experiencing swollen gums, persistent bad breath, or gum recession, our expert team is here to help. Visit Krishna Dental for professional gum care and regain a healthy, pain-free smile.
